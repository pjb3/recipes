Mushrooms, Kale, Potatoes
=========================

Ingredients
-----------

* 3 cups chunked Yukon Gold or red potatoes
* 2 onions, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 4 to 5 cups chopped exotic mushrooms (see tip)
* 6 cups packed, coarsely chopped dinosaur kale, stems removed
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 to 2 teaspoons chile paste
* Freshly ground black pepper

Steps
-----

1. Put the potatoes in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook until fairly tender, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, put the onion, garlic, and mushrooms in a large nonstick sauté pan or wok. Do not add any liquid. Dry-fry over medium heat, stirring frequently, for about 5 to 6 minutes, until onions and mushrooms are fairly tender. Add the kale and stir gently to combine. Continue to cook, stirring frequently for about 2 minutes. Add the cooked potatoes. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 more minutes, then add the soy sauce, chile paste, and pepper to taste. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until kale is tender and potatoes are somewhat browned. Serve warm.

Notes
-----

Tip Use any assortment of firm small potatoes or fingerlings, cut into bitesize pieces. Watch them carefully during boiling: don’t let them get overcooked.

Tip Assorted exotic mushrooms, such as clamshell, trumpet, oyster, and chanterelle, are available in most markets. Uses about 1 pound.

Tip If you can’t get dinosaur kale (also called Lacinato Blue), use regular kale. To easily remove the stems from any kind of kale, grasp the bottom of the stem with one hand, gently but firmly grasp the leafy part with your other hand, and pull upward along the stem.
